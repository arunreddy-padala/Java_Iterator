# Look_and_Say_Iterator_Java

This Java project implements the look-and-say sequence generator using the Iterator design pattern. The sequence is constructed such that each number is generated by describing the count of digits appearing in the previous number. The implementation caters to multiple constructors and ensures robust boundary management through custom exception handling.

Languages and Frameworks: Java, JUnit4, Design Patterns 

Features:
- Multiple Constructors:
A) Primary constructor takes a starting seed and an explicit end value, throwing an IllegalArgumentException for invalid inputs.
B) Secondary constructor initializes with a seed, setting the end value to the largest 100-digit number possible.
C) Default constructor starts the sequence at 1, with no need for initial arguments.
- Iterator Controls:
A) next(): Advances to and returns the next number in the sequence. Throws NoSuchElementException if the sequence can't advance.
B) prev(): Returns the previous number in the sequence. Throws NoSuchElementException if there is no previous value.
C) hasNext(): Checks if the next number in the sequence is still under the specified end value.
D)) hasPreferred(): Determines the possibility of retracing the sequence one step backward.
- Exception Handling: Custom exceptions manage non-positive seeds, presence of zeros in seeds, or seeds exceeding end values.
- Testing:
A) Comprehensive testing is performed using JUnit4, covering Edge cases for constructor parameters.
B) Functional testing of next(), prev(), hasNext(), and hasPrev() methods.
